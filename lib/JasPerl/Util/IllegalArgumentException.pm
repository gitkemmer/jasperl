=head1 SYNOPSIS

use JasPerl::Util::IllegalArgumentException;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A full description of the module and its features.
May include numerous subsections (i.e. =head2, =head3, etc.)

=head1 SUBROUTINES/METHODS

A separate section listing the public components of the module's
interface.  These normally consist of either subroutines that may be
exported, or methods that may be called on objects belonging to the
classes that the module provides.  Name the section accordingly.

In an object-oriented module, this section should begin with a
sentence of the form "An object of this class represents...", to give
the reader a high-level context to help them understand the methods
that are subsequently described.

=head1 DIAGNOSTICS

A list of every error and warning message that the module can generate
(even the ones that will "never happen"), with a full explanation of
each problem, one or more likely causes, and any suggested remedies.

=head1 DEPENDENCIES

A list of all the other modules that this module relies upon,
including any restrictions on versions, and an indication whether
these required modules are part of the standard Perl distribution,
part of the module's distribution, or must be installed separately.

=head1 BUGS AND LIMITATIONS

There are no known bugs in this module.
